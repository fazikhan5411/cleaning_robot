With the advancement of innovation and technology, mobile cleaning robots are getting
more attention of researchers to make life of mankind comfortable. Households of today
are becoming smarter and more automated. Home automation delivers convenience and
creates more time for people. There exist many cleaning robot but they have not used
motion planning algorithms to clean the environment. Some robotâ€™s move randomly to
clean the surroundings while some robots use SLAM techniques to clean the area but
they are too much expensive. In this project, we have developed a cleaning robot and
efficient motion planning algorithm in which robot follow a zig-zag trajectory. This project is accomplished on Robot Operating System (ROS) which is very modern tool for
real world simulations .This project includes the robot modeling, SLAM, autonomous
mapping using frontier based algorithm, map tagging, autonomous navigation and efficient planning algorithm. This cleaning robot can perform in both modes i.e. manual as
well as autonomous. Frontier based Exploration algorithm is used to make autonomous
map. This work can be very useful in improving life style of mankind.
